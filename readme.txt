In this experiment of creating a nicer aesthetic, files are stored externally and code is written to link them. Note Moodle's file management system is a nightmare especially when creating new instances of the same module

public_html

Currently this is being stored in public on dropbox. Ideally this folder should be hosted on a web server. (replace all links if making the change).
It is being used with the 3 card layout. The code for the card layout is stored in 3 card_template_leet.html
